Principal Component Analysis combines the effect of some similar variables into a Principal 
Component column. It is a dimensionality reduction technique which focuses on creating a totally 
new variable, or a Principal Component from all the variables through an equation to grasp most
variation possible. 

It will help us in using only a few components which take into account the most important, 
and most varying variables instead of using all 50 variables present in the data. 

We plot cumulative variance vs no. of components to see how variance changes with the number of features selected.

From the graph we can see that 35 components capture around 90% of variance
